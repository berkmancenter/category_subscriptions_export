# Category Subscription Exports

Export Category Subscription Data.

## Description

This plugin makes the list of [category subscription](https://github.com/berkmancenter/category_subscriptions) subscribers available for download as a CSV. Thus allowing export and manipulation of that data.

Once the plugin has been activated, visit your settings page, and under the settings menu there will be an option page titled "Export Category Subscriptions Data". Pressing the button on that page will download a CSV of all the data. 

The CSV has two pieces of data for each subscription the preference and the subscription. 

 * *The Subscription*: 0 or 1 depending on if the user is subscribed, the purpose of this was to allow site admins to analyze the data by running formulas (i.e. sum a column to get aggregate data). 
 * *The Preference*: The delivery preference the user has for that option.
